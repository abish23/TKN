      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        Thirukoneswarar Nadanalayam was founded to preserve and teach the classical Indian dance form Bharatanatyam in Europe.
        For over a decade, our school has been a home for students seeking a deep connection between body, rhythm, and spirituality.
      </p>
      <p>
        Led by <strong>Dr. Chandravathane</strong>, our school combines traditional values with modern pedagogy.
        Every step and movement is an expression of inner devotion - dance as a prayer in motion.
